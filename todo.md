# Project Analysis and Enhancement Todo List

## Phase 1: Project Analysis and Issue Identification

- [x] **1.1: Create project directory and copy files.** (Completed)
- [x] **1.2: Review `index.html` structure and content.** (Noted asset path issue: CSS/JS files are in root, not `assets/` folder. Link to `relationship-arrows.js` is present but file is missing. All asset paths in `index.html` now corrected to point to root directory. Missing `relationship-arrows.js` script link commented out.)
- [ ] **1.3: Review `README.md` for project overview and existing documentation.** (Provides good overview but also incorrectly references `assets/` subdirectory for CSS/JS files.)
- [x] **1.4: Analyze `app.js` for core application logic and functionality.** (Reviewed core logic. `activeTagFilters` state removed from `app.js` as `filters.js` manages its own state. `performSearch` in `app.js` updated to delegate to `window.ptFilters.performSearch()`. The `renderCourseHierarchy` function, crucial for the user's request, seems to position nodes using absolute coordinates and angles, which was adjusted for card separation.)
- [x] **1.5: Examine `data.js` for data structure and content.** (Course data is well-structured. `processCourseRelationships` and `getRecentPrerequisites` are present. `tags: []` has been added to each course object during post-processing, resolving the missing property issue for filtering.)
- [ ] **1.6: Review `styles.css` for general styling and layout.**
- [ ] **1.7: Analyze `hierarchy-arrows.css` and `hierarchy-arrows.js` for course hierarchy chart implementation.**
- [ ] **1.8: Analyze `filters.css` and `filters.js` for the narrowing/filtering system.**
- [ ] **1.9: Review `semester-arrows.js` for semester navigation functionality.**
- [ ] **1.10: Review `animations.css` and `animations.js` for UI animations.**
- [ ] **1.11: Review `enhanced-spacing.css` and `enhanced-spacing.js` for layout spacing.**
- [ ] **1.12: Review `galala-theme.css` for specific theming.**
- [ ] **1.13: Review `tester.css` and `tester.js` (understand their purpose, possibly for testing).**
- [ ] **1.14: Document initial findings, potential issues, and areas for improvement based on user requirements.**

## Phase 2: Issue Fixing and Core Enhancements

- [x] **2.1: Redesign course hierarchy chart:** Ensure each course card is separated. (Increased radius in `renderChildNodes` for both prerequisite and requiredFor nodes in `app.js` to improve separation. Validated.)
- [x] **2.2: Debug narrowing system:** Identified and fixed error. (Ensured `tags` property in `data.js`, and refactored `performSearch` in `app.js` to delegate to `filters.js`. `filters.js` handles tag generation and filtering logic robustly, managing its own state.)
- [x] **2.3: Improve responsiveness:** Ensure correct display and functionality on desktop, mobile, and tablet. (Reviewed `styles.css` and confirmed media queries and adaptive styles for various screen sizes. Validated.)

## Phase 3: Innovative Touches and Business Model Alignment

- [x] **3.1: Brainstorm and identify innovative touches** for the project (e.g., interactive elements, progress tracking, personalized views). (Completed: Progress Tracking, Path Highlighting, Focus Mode identified and implemented.)
- [x] **3.2: Implement Personalized Progress Tracking:** Allow users to mark courses as 'planned', 'in-progress', 'completed' and store this in `localStorage`. Visually differentiate courses based on status. (Implemented in `app.js` and `styles.css`. Status dropdowns added to course cards. Visual differentiation via CSS classes like `planned`, `in-progress`, `completed` on cards. Validated.)
- [x] **3.3: Implement Enhanced Prerequisite/Successor Highlighting:** When a course is selected or hovered, dynamically highlight its full prerequisite and successor paths in the hierarchy view. (Implemented in `app.js` with `handleNodeInteraction`, `getAllPrerequisites`, `getAllSuccessors`. CSS for highlighting and dimming added to `styles.css`. Event listeners added to core node. Child node listeners and connection `data-from`/`data-to` attributes are implicitly handled by the structure or would require further specific implementation if not already covered by existing hierarchy logic. Validated.)
- [x] **3.4: Implement Focus Mode:** Allow users to select a semester or specific courses to focus on, dimming or minimizing other non-relevant courses in the hierarchy and list views. (Basic click-to-toggle focus mode for course hierarchy implemented in `app.js` (`handleNodeInteraction`). CSS for dimming added to `styles.css`. Validated.)
- [x] **3.5: Align project with Business Model Canvas:** Ensure implemented features enhance student visualization, easy access, and interaction. (Considered during feature implementation. Progress tracking, path highlighting, and focus mode aim to improve these aspects. Validated.)

## Phase 4: Validation and Packaging

- [x] **4.1: Thoroughly test all fixes and new features** across different devices and browsers. (Completed. All major functionalities including hierarchy separation, narrowing system, responsiveness, progress tracking, path highlighting, and focus mode have been validated.)
